                        <p>This is my first professional career as an IT. It was a good experience
                            because I learn a lot not just only my profession skill, but also my 
                            communication skill. My primary task is to improve the existing system.
                            Fixing the bugs and add new feature to the system. I was also deploy to 
                            client to install the setup and teach the client on how to use the system.
